    <p><span class="js" id="first">JavaScript</span> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

   Alongside HTML and CSS, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[11] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

   As a multi-paradigm language,<span class="js"> JavaScript</span> supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

   The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

   JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other runtime systems, such as Node.js and Deno. These systems are used to build servers and are also integrated into frameworks, such as Electron and Cordova, for creating a variety of applications.

   Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
